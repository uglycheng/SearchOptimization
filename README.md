* Stochastic methods: Simulated Annealing, Cross Entropy, Search Gradient
<br>**A-Star Search**
<br>**Minimax Search**
<br>**Markov Decision Process**
* Value Iteration
* Policy Iteration
<br>**Reinforcement Learning**
* Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation
* Temporal Difference Policy Evaluation
* Tabular Q learning
