# SearchOptimization
This is a course project of UCSD CSE257 with Prof.Sicun Gao. It includes implementation of following methods:
- **Numerical Optimizers**
  - Gradient based methods: Gradient Descent, Newtown Descent, Conjugate Descent
  - Stochastic methods: Simulated Annealing, Cross Entropy, Search Gradient
- **A-Star Search**
- **Minimax Search**
- **Markov Decision Process**
  - Value Iteration
  - Policy Iteration
- **Reinforcement Learning**
  - Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation
  - Temporal Difference Policy Evaluation
  - Tabular Q learning
  - Deep Q Learning
